# Gemini Hotel Group: Performance Analysis (2018-2020)
Gemini Hotel Group operates two hotel types: city and resort. The Director of Development aims to understand past sales performance and identify trends in customer behavior. To address this, a Power BI dashboard was developed to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs).

## Requirements Gathered From the Stakeholders:

1. **Revenue Growth:** Is our hotel revenue increasing year-over-year?
2. **Parking Capacity:** Should we expand our parking facilities?
3. **Data Trend:** What trends are evident in the data?

### Findings:

- **Revenue Growth:** Total revenue has increased from 2018 to 2020, with a slight fluctuation in 2020 likely due to COVID-19 impacts.
- **Revenue and Hotel Types:** Both hotel type contributes almost equally to the total revenue.
- **Parking Utilization:** Parking needs generally remain below 5%.
- **Discount Trends:** Customers consistently receive an average discount of 25.8% across various booking channels.

### Recommendations:

- **Parking Capacity:** Based on historical data, there's no immediate need to expand parking facilities. However, future customer behavior changes may necessitate a reevaluation.
- **Location and Hotel Type:** Location and hotel type significantly influence parking requirements. For example, US resort hotel guests exhibit higher parking needs.

### Additional Considerations:

- **Data Completeness:** Address the missing 2020 data to obtain a more accurate picture of recent trends.
- **Customer Segmentation:** Deeper analysis of customer segments (e.g., business, leisure) can provide valuable insights into parking and other preferences.
- **External Factors:** Consider the impact of external factors like economic conditions and travel trends on future demand.
