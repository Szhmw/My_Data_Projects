# Zomato App User Analysis

Zomato is an Indian multinational restaurant aggregator and food delivery company. I conducted a User Segmentation and Purchasing Behavior Analysis using data from 2017 to 2020. Interactive Tableau dashboard can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/154c09gO-8WQbQjvOvaSoOuDUcLTevvq7/view?usp=sharing).

### Key Metrics and Dimensions:
#
- **Total Sales:** How many sales made in total.
- **Total Order Amount:** How many orders placed in total.
- **Total Quantity:** Total quantity ordered.
- **Gender:** Female & Male.
- **Age:** User Age.
- **Marital Status:** Married or not.
- **Weekday:** Day of week.
- **Month:** Month of year.

### Findings:
#
- **Age and Occupation:** Zomato’s user base is young (users’ ages are between 18 and 33). 
Age groups from 22 to 25 contributed to most of the sales. The most active of them are students. These active users are more likely to be single and have received higher education.

- **Gender & Marital Status comparison:** But female users and married users were less engaged.

- **Seasonality:** Users placed the most orders during weekdays, with a peak on Fridays. But the order amount plunged on the weekends. 
January and November saw the highest surge in sales and orders. Monsoon season (June to September) brought in less orders and sales probably due to the disruption of the delivery system by heavy rain.

- **Cuisine Popularity:** Indian (sometimes Chinese Indian fusion) cuisines dominated among all the cuisines.

### Recommendations:
#
- Create marketing campaigns aimed at female customers, married couples, and employees to expand the customer base.
- Offer promotions and special deals during the weekend to boost sales on the weekends
- Look into if weather is the reason why sales are low during the monsoon season.
- Encourage restaurants specializing in other cuisines other than Indian food to offer discounts to drive sales.
